Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Pig LatinPassed

Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:

- If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add "ay" to it.

- If a word begins with a vowel, just add "way" at the end.

Translate the provided string to Pig Latin. Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase.

#####Solution#####

const translatePigLatin = str => {

  if (str.match(/^[aeiou]/)){
    return str + 'way';
  }
  
  var beginMatch = str.match(/^[^aeiou]+/g).join();
  var deleteFirst = str.slice(beginMatch.length);
  
  return deleteFirst + beginMatch + 'ay';
  
  };
